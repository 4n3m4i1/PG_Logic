# ProgrammaGull Logic
Small and open source FPGA development boards for all those still pecking for fries.  
  

## Hardware
Design files provided for KiCad 7.
  
### PGL Sandpiper
An education focused development platform, full of fun I/O and devices for users to learn the basics of real world FPGA development. The board centers around the Lattice iCE40-UP5k, which itself offers ample BRAM, PSRAM, 8 DSP Blocks, a PLL, and two internal oscillators.

### PGL E3
An iCE40-UP5k SG48 development board and associated programmer board.  
Designed to be embeddable and flexible enough for most projects!  
  
### PGL E6
A small embeddable Lattice iCE40-LP384 aimed at alleviating the overhead incurred when adding glue logic or general PL space into a project.

### PGL E6-NF
The same PGL E6 but with no flash, allowing smaller footprints when accompanied by some external bitstream source (MCU, external flash, other FPGA, etc..)
